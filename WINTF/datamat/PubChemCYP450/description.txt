chem-CYP450 binding assay data from PubChem
Chem-chem matrix was generated using PaDeL, Extended Fingerprint.
Cosine similarity using the FP vectors as similarity. sim<0.5 were filtered out.
prot-prot matrix generated using blastp (sequence), bitscore ratio. sim<0.5 were filtered out.

Test and Validation indices are for deep learning combined with matlab works.
The files contain (chemIdx, protIdx, Association). 
The indices are 0-based (python index). +1 should be applied for matlab works.
